       <h1>MY EDUCATION BACKGROUND</h1>
     <img src="Image 1.jpg" alt=""id="image 1">
     <p>SPM - SMK CHABANG EMPAT (2013 - 2017)</p>
     <p>I studied at this school for five years, from 2013 to 2017, and received satisfactory SPM results. Even though this is a regular school, I learned a lot of things here that I don't think I could have learned anywhere else. It is the location where I made thousands of memories as a student and teenager.</p>

     <p> DIPLOMA IN ACCOUNTING - UITM MACHANG, KELANTAN (2018 - 2021)</p>
     <p>Just after SPM, I was given the opportunity to continue my studies in Accounting at UITM Machang. This is where my journey as a university student began. I was initially concerned that I would underperform this course because I had heard it was challenging, but I persisted because I am passionate about accounting. With the help of others, I overcame all of the challenges as time passed. At this age, they have many good and bad memories with friends and family. </p>

     <p>BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (HONS) ISLAMIC BANKING - UITM KOTA BHARU, KELANTAN (2021 - 2023)</p>
     <P>After finishing my diploma, I was given the opportunity to continue my education at UiTM as a Bachelor's Degree student. It is also in Kelantan because perhaps the time has not yet come for me to go outside. Until now, I've had to deal with my online studies. So far, no memories with degree's friends have been formed, but this may change soon. Now I just go with the flow of my studies and wait for the statement for my courses to begin studying in real life.</P>
